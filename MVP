As a user, I want to be able to add new job applications that I’m thinking about applying to or have already applied to. For each job, I should be able to note down important stuff like the company’s name, the job title, what stage the application is at, and if I want, some personal notes and the link to the job posting.
As a user, I want to see all the jobs I’ve applied for in one place. This page should just show the job title and the company name for each job to keep it simple and easy to look at.
As a user, I need to be able to click on any job in my list and see all the details about it on a new page. This includes everything I’ve recorded about that job application.
As a user, when I’m looking at all the details of a job application, I want to be able to change any of the information. There should be an easy-to-find link that takes me to a different page where I can make these changes and then save them.
As a user, if I’m looking at the details of a job application, I want a simple way to delete it completely, like clicking a ‘Delete’ button.
